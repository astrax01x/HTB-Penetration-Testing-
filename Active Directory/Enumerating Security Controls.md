After gaining a foothold, we could use this access to get a feeling for the defensive state of the hosts, enumerate the domain further now that our visibility is not as restricted, and, if necessary, work at "living off the land" by using tools that exist natively on the hosts.

*Note: This section is intended to showcase possible security controls in place within a domain, but does not have an interactive component. Enumerating and bypassing security controls are outside the scope of this module, but we wanted to give an overview of the possible technologies we may encounter during an assessment.*

## Windows Defender

Windows Defender (or [Microsoft Defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender) after the Windows 10 May 2020 Update) has greatly improved over the years and, by default, will block tools such as `PowerView`. There are ways to bypass these protections. These ways will be covered in other modules. We can use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet [Get-MpComputerStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?view=win10-ps) to get the current Defender status. Here, we can see that the `RealTimeProtectionEnabled` parameter is set to `True`, which means Defender is enabled on the system.
