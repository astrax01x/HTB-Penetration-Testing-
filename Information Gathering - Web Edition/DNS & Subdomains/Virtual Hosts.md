## How Virtual Hosts Work: Understanding VHosts and Subdomains

At the core of `virtual hosting` is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the `HTTP Host` header, a piece of information included in every `HTTP` request sent by a web browser.

The key difference between `VHosts` and `subdomains` is their relationship to the `Domain Name System (DNS)` and the web server's configuration.

- `Subdomains`: These are extensions of a main domain name (e.g., `blog.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`). `Subdomains` typically have their own `DNS records`, pointing to either the same IP address as the main domain or a different one. They can be used to organise different sections or services of a website.
- `Virtual Hosts` (`VHosts`): Virtual hosts are configurations within a web server that allow multiple websites or applications to be hosted on a single server. They can be associated with top-level domains (e.g., `example.com`) or subdomains (e.g., `dev.example.com`). Each virtual host can have its own separate configuration, enabling precise control over how requests are handled.

If a virtual host does not have a DNS record, you can still access it by modifying the `hosts` file on your local machine. The `hosts` file allows you to map a domain name to an IP address manually, bypassing DNS resolution.

### Types of Virtual Hosting

There are three primary types of virtual hosting, each with its advantages and drawbacks:

1. `Name-Based Virtual Hosting`: This method relies solely on the `HTTP Host header` to distinguish between websites. It is the most common and flexible method, as it doesn't require multiple IP addresses. It’s cost-effective, easy to set up, and supports most modern web servers. However, it requires the web server to support name-based `virtual hosting` and can have limitations with certain protocols like `SSL/TLS`.
2. `IP-Based Virtual Hosting`: This type of hosting assigns a unique IP address to each website hosted on the server. The server determines which website to serve based on the IP address to which the request was sent. It doesn't rely on the `Host header`, can be used with any protocol, and offers better isolation between websites. Still, it requires multiple IP addresses, which can be expensive and less scalable.
3. `Port-Based Virtual Hosting`: Different websites are associated with different ports on the same IP address. For example, one website might be accessible on port 80, while another is on port 8080. `Port-based virtual hosting` can be used when IP addresses are limited, but it’s not as common or user-friendly as `name-based virtual hosting` and might require users to specify the port number in the URL.

## Virtual Host Discovery Tools

While manual analysis of `HTTP headers` and reverse `DNS lookups` can be effective, specialised `virtual host discovery tools` automate and streamline the process, making it more efficient and comprehensive. These tools employ various techniques to probe the target server and uncover potential `virtual hosts`.

Several tools are available to aid in the discovery of virtual hosts:

| Tool                                                 | Description                                                                                                      | Features                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)           | A multi-purpose tool often used for directory/file brute-forcing, but also effective for virtual host discovery. | Fast, supports multiple HTTP methods, can use custom wordlists. |
| [Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) | Similar to Gobuster, but with a Rust-based implementation, known for its speed and flexibility.                  | Supports recursion, wildcard discovery, and various filters.    |
| [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)                 | Another fast web fuzzer that can be used for virtual host discovery by fuzzing the `Host` header.                | Customizable wordlist input and filtering options.              |
### gobuster

Gobuster is a versatile tool commonly used for directory and file brute-forcing, but it also excels at virtual host discovery. It systematically sends HTTP requests with different `Host` headers to a target IP address and then analyses the responses to identify valid virtual hosts.

There are a couple of things you need to prepare to brute force `Host` headers:

1. `Target Identification`: First, identify the target web server's IP address. This can be done through DNS lookups or other reconnaissance techniques.
2. `Wordlist Preparation`: Prepare a wordlist containing potential virtual host names. You can use a pre-compiled wordlist, such as SecLists, or create a custom one based on your target's industry, naming conventions, or other relevant information.

The `gobuster` command to bruteforce vhosts generally looks like this

	AstraX01@htb[/htb]$ gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain

- **The `--append-domain` flag appends the base domain to each word in the wordlist.**
